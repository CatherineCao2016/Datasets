Bruno The King Of Ravioli Company Inc,Grocery Stores,"In 1888 Bruno Cavalli had a dream. Bruno dreamt of coming to America to provide for his family better then he could ever imagine. He left the Piedmont region of Italy to start his quest in America, but only could find work as a busboy, then soon a waiter. While Bruno waited tables, he noticed that many of his customers from the Old Country asked for fresh ravioli, however there were no restaurants in New York serving ravioli. So, Bruno found a New World niche and started to make ravioli to serve to his customers. Bruno had a small side business of making handmade fresh meat or cheese ravioli, packing them in shoeboxes, and delivering on his bicycle. In 1905 Bruno had opened his first shop called Bruno Ravioli where he sold his homemade pastas, sauces, and Italian delicacies. Bruno's wife helped at the counter and his sons Louis and Amerigo slept in cradles made of spaghetti crates in the back of the shop. As the boys grew up, there were sent out on bicycles delivering Bruno's famous product."
